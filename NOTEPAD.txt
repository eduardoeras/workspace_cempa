    To Do:
        Use the Wi-Fi

    Parameterization:
        Implement Taylor based on Yonsey University
        Main goal: Run the YU twice, as two differente parameterization options
        Focus on run the parameterizations offline
        Attention: parameter call order is not linear, need to figure out how it works
